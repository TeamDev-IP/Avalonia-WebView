<p>This example shows how transparency works for the web pages in DotNetBrowser.</p>
<p>
	The web page has no style specified for its &lt;body&gt; tag. When the transparency
	is enabled, the web page background changes from white to transparent,
	and you can see the underlying control background instead of the white background of the web page.
</p>
<p>
	If this web page is loaded into a semi-transparent or a completely transparent window, and the transparency is enabled for the browser,
	you can see the window transparency effects instead of the web page background.

<div style="background: red;">

	This text is in the red opaque div and should appear as is.

</div>
<div>

	This text is in the non-styled div and should appear as a text
	on the completely transparent background.
